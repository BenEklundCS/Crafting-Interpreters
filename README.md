# Crafting Interpreters - Study & Development  

This repository follows my journey through [*Crafting Interpreters*](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom. The code here is not my original work in full but is developed alongside the book as a learning exercise. My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of language implementation by writing and refining the Lox interpreter, both in its tree-walk and bytecode forms.  

## Progress  

- Nearly complete with the Tree-Walk Interpreter Java implementation of Lox
- Will soon start implementing clox, the Bytecode Interpreting Virtual Machine version of Lox

## Goals  

- Implement Lox with different versions of Interpreted Language evaluation
- Gain a solid understanding of scanning, parsing, evaluation, and bytecode execution  
- Extend and experiment beyond the bookâ€™s implementation
- Learn enough to write a varient of Lox or my own scripting language after the study

## Notes  

This project is for educational purposes only. The original work belongs to Robert Nystrom. If you're interested in building interpreters, I highly recommend reading [*Crafting Interpreters*](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).
